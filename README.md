### Appliance energy control using MPC
#### This is a very basic implementation of MPC control for appliance energy control based on available data
#### for those already familiar with the concept of MPC, this code solves the proble posed by solving an optimization problem

#### The trained model 'energy_reg_model.joblib' is too large and you have to run the regmodels.py again to generate it locally in you machine
